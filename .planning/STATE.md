# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Changes to the Claude environment on any machine automatically propagate to all other machines -- zero manual sync effort.
**Current focus:** All v1 plans complete. 6/6 plans across 3 phases executed.

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Cross-Platform and Bootstrap) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: All v1 milestone plans complete
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Completed Plan 03-02 (Bootstrap Command)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 24 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2/2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 2. Sync Operations | 2/2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 3. Cross-Platform | 2/2 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (4 min), 02-01 (5 min), 02-02 (4 min), 03-01 (5 min), 03-02 (3 min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 03 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 03 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from 10 v1 requirements (coarse granularity). Foundation -> Sync Ops -> Cross-Platform.
- [Roadmap]: Research suggested 4 phases, but Phases 3-4 from research (auto-sync daemon, UX polish) map entirely to v2 requirements. v1 scope is 3 phases.
- [01-01]: Used real temp directories (fs.mkdtemp) for scanner tests instead of mocking fs
- [01-01]: Allowlist uses startsWith for directory targets (ending with /) and exact match for files
- [01-01]: Path rewriter uses simple string replaceAll -- no regex needed since home dir paths are literal
- [Phase 01-02]: Derived homeDir from claudeDir parent instead of os.homedir() for correct path rewriting
- [Phase 01-02]: Extracted handleInit() from Commander action handler for direct testability
- [Phase 01-02]: Used named import { simpleGit } for Node16 module resolution compatibility
- [Phase 02-01]: Set upstream tracking in fetch tests for accurate ahead/behind reporting
- [Phase 02-01]: Used scanDirectory for both source and destination to ensure consistent allowlisting
- [Phase 02-01]: Backup stored alongside sync repo in .claude-sync-backups directory
- [Phase 02-02]: Followed init.ts handleX/registerXCommand pattern for all three CLI commands
- [Phase 02-02]: Migrated biome.json schema from 2.0.0 to 2.4.6 to fix pre-existing lint config errors
- [Phase 02-02]: Followed init.ts handleX/registerXCommand pattern for all three CLI commands
- [Phase 02-02]: Migrated biome.json schema from 2.0.0 to 2.4.6 to fix pre-existing lint config errors
- [Phase 03-01]: Used replaceAll("\\", "/") instead of split(path.sep).join("/") so normalizePath works as universal normalizer regardless of OS
- [Phase 03-01]: Handle JSON-escaped double-backslash Windows paths in rewritePathsForRepo since settings.json content has escaped backslashes
- [Phase 03-01]: Used regex capture group after {{HOME}} token to normalize all backslashes in path suffix
- [Phase 03-02]: Derived homeDir from claudeDir parent for path expansion consistency
- [Phase 03-02]: Used scanDirectory on sync repo and claudeDir for consistent allowlisting
