# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Changes to the Claude environment on any machine automatically propagate to all other machines -- zero manual sync effort.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 complete. All sync operations (push, pull, status) implemented with CLI commands. Phase 3 (Cross-Platform) is next.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Sync Operations) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Phase 2 complete, ready for Phase 3 (Cross-Platform)
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Completed Plan 02-02 (CLI Commands)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 16 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2/2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 2. Sync Operations | 2/2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (4 min), 02-01 (5 min), 02-02 (4 min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from 10 v1 requirements (coarse granularity). Foundation -> Sync Ops -> Cross-Platform.
- [Roadmap]: Research suggested 4 phases, but Phases 3-4 from research (auto-sync daemon, UX polish) map entirely to v2 requirements. v1 scope is 3 phases.
- [01-01]: Used real temp directories (fs.mkdtemp) for scanner tests instead of mocking fs
- [01-01]: Allowlist uses startsWith for directory targets (ending with /) and exact match for files
- [01-01]: Path rewriter uses simple string replaceAll -- no regex needed since home dir paths are literal
- [Phase 01-02]: Derived homeDir from claudeDir parent instead of os.homedir() for correct path rewriting
- [Phase 01-02]: Extracted handleInit() from Commander action handler for direct testability
- [Phase 01-02]: Used named import { simpleGit } for Node16 module resolution compatibility
- [Phase 02-01]: Set upstream tracking in fetch tests for accurate ahead/behind reporting
- [Phase 02-01]: Used scanDirectory for both source and destination to ensure consistent allowlisting
- [Phase 02-01]: Backup stored alongside sync repo in .claude-sync-backups directory
- [Phase 02-02]: Followed init.ts handleX/registerXCommand pattern for all three CLI commands
- [Phase 02-02]: Migrated biome.json schema from 2.0.0 to 2.4.6 to fix pre-existing lint config errors
- [Phase 02-02]: Followed init.ts handleX/registerXCommand pattern for all three CLI commands
- [Phase 02-02]: Migrated biome.json schema from 2.0.0 to 2.4.6 to fix pre-existing lint config errors
